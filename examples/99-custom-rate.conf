# Force 48kHz sample rate for all devices to prevent pitch shifting
# This is especially important for HDMI capture cards and mixed USB/PCI audio setups
#
# Why 48kHz?
# - Professional audio standard
# - Prevents pitch shifting when mixing devices
# - Compatible with most modern audio hardware
# - Required for proper HDMI capture card operation
#
# Installation:
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
#   cp 99-custom-rate.conf ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
#   systemctl --user restart pipewire.service
