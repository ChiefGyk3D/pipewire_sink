# WirePlumber configuration to disable audio device suspend
# This prevents audio "popping" at the start of playback by keeping
# audio devices active instead of entering power-saving mode.
#
# Install to: ~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/50-no-suspend.conf
#
# This is especially useful for USB audio devices like RØDECaster Pro II
# that may produce audible pops when waking from suspend.
