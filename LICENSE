license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and other software
or hardware, but shall not apply to any other means of combining the
Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any arrangements made by
You with a third party to derogate from the patent rights of a Contributor.

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are effective on the date the Covered
Software is first distributed by the Licensor or Contributor, and terminate
automatically if You materially breach this License.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Distribution of Source Form Covered Software

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided
that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered
Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software and other

ensure that the licensed files retain any existing copyright statements and
notices.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute or

apply to. Such description must be included in a file included with the Source

this License or the use of the Covered Software, including but not limited to
any lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental or consequential damages.

8. Miscellaneous
